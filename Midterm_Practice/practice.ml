(* Part 1: define a function that computes the parity of a list of
   booleans.

   What we want is a function even_parity such as even_parity l
   returns a boolean that combined with the elements of l the 
   number of 1â€™s (true) is even.
   This is a simple but important algorithm in data communication, its
   purpose is to detect errors (one bit flips). It is very easy to
   implement in circuit but it is not very reliable.
 *)

(* This version is very natural but it is not tail recursive. Let's
   make the tail recursive version. *)

let even_parity_tr l =
  let rec parity p = function
    | [] -> p
    | p'::xs -> parity (p<>p') xs
  in

(* Part 2: Now prove that both functions are equivalent. You will need to use facts about the <> (XOR) operation *)

in class.
